Here are 20 tough JavaScript practical interview questions that test various aspects of the language:

Explain the event loop in JavaScript and how it handles asynchronous code. Provide an example with setTimeout and Promise.

What is closure in JavaScript? Can you provide an example of how closures can be used to create private variables?

What are the differences between null, undefined, and NaN? How would you check if a variable is null or undefined?

What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript? Can you explain with examples?

Explain how the this keyword works in JavaScript. How does it behave differently in regular functions, arrow functions, and classes?

What is the purpose of the bind(), call(), and apply() methods in JavaScript? How do they differ?

How would you flatten a deeply nested array using JavaScript? Can you provide both iterative and recursive solutions?

How do you prevent a function from being called more than once in a short period of time (debouncing and throttling)?

What is the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript? Can you provide examples where each would be used?

How does JavaScript handle asynchronous operations and callbacks? What are the potential pitfalls, and how can they be avoided (e.g., callback hell)?

Explain the concept of "hoisting" in JavaScript. What gets hoisted, and how does it affect variable declarations and function declarations?

What are Promises in JavaScript? How do they work, and what is the difference between then() and catch() methods? Can you chain them?

What is the difference between a deep copy and a shallow copy of an object? How would you implement both in JavaScript?

Explain the concept of prototypes in JavaScript. How does inheritance work in JavaScript, and what is the role of the prototype chain?

How would you implement a custom map(), filter(), or reduce() method for arrays in JavaScript?

What are async and await in JavaScript? How do they simplify asynchronous code compared to using Promise chains?

What is the purpose of the Symbol type in JavaScript? Can you provide an example of how and why you would use it?

What is a "memoization" technique in JavaScript? How would you implement a simple memoization function to optimize a slow recursive function?

How would you implement a JavaScript function to detect if a string is a palindrome, considering performance?

Explain the concept of "currying" in JavaScript. Can you provide an example of currying and how it can be used to create more reusable functions?
