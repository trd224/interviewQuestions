jit and aot in angular

Que: differance between constructor an ngOnInit

ans: constructor and ngOnInit are both methods in Angular, but they have different purposes.

constructor is a special method that is called when a class is instantiated. It is used to initialize the class's properties and set up the class's dependencies. This method is part of the TypeScript language, and is not specific to Angular.

ngOnInit is a lifecycle hook method in Angular that is called after the constructor and after the input properties have been initialized. It is used to perform any additional initialization that needs to be done before the component is rendered. This method is specific to Angular.

In summary, constructor is used to initialize the class, while ngOnInit is used to initialize the component.
